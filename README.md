# Final-Project
Final Project for CS50x

This will be a labor tracker for logging hours spent doing labor-creditable work for Twin Oaks Community

Will include a weekly table that can be filled out and possibly submitted to the labor assigners for data entry
starts on Friday ends on Thursday

columns headers will be the day, the first column will have a select feild where the correct labor code can be selected
all other column feilds will allow the user to input a type float to the hundredths place.

At the bottom a sum for each day will be displayed as well as a current total hours for the week.
Checkbox for labor sheet turned in on time?
Notice to submit labor sheet to assigners on time?

a database will be used to store data relevant to the user, which can then be used to output historical trends, total hours spent in each labor field, as well as estimated labor balance year-to-date.
